## Coding Task Content
### 1. quiz.py
Implement the following functions:
```
def reverse_list(l: list):
    """
    Reverse a list without using any built-in function.
    The function should return a reversed list.
    Input l is a list that may contain any type of data.
    """
    pass
```
```
def solve_sudoku(matrix):
    """
    Write a program to solve a 9*9 Sudoku board.
    The board must be completed so that every row, column and 3*3 exction
    contains all digits from 1 to 9.
    Input: a 9*9 matrix representing the board
    """
    pass
```
### 2. webapp/main.py
#### Requirements
Build a web service using FastAPI with the following at least two API endpoints.
1. Image Upload and Compression Endpoint
* Allows users to upload an image and provides a compressed version of that image.
* All logic must be implemented within the service itself
* The compression algorithm does not need to be advanced -- basic functionally is sufficient; compression quality doesn't matter.
* Need to consider that the API is being accessed concurrently (). 
2. Processing History Endpoint
* Returns the history of processed images.
* No database configurations is required.
* All storage must be in-memory only.
#### Restrictions
* Do not use any external services such as cloud platforms(e.g., S3), serverless environments, or third-party SDKs/APIs.
* No additional external dependencies should be introduced.
* Please consider various edge cases, and the solution should fully reflect the reliability, performance, readability, and other qualities that good code should possess.
#### README Requirement
Please includes a README file that explains how to review and test your application.
#### Important Notes
* This assignment evaluates your design and development skills.
* Make your service robust and reilable. Consider edge cases.
* Additional features are not required, but feel free to include them if you believe they are essential.
* Focus on code quality over feature quantity.
### 3. review.py
Review and refactor the following five code snippets. Identify any issues, explain the problems, and provide corrected versions.
```
# Review 1
def add_to_list(value, my_list=[]):
    my_list.append(value)
    return my_list
# Review 2
def format_greeting(name, age):
    return "Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old."
# Review 3
class Counter:
    count = 0
    def __init__(self):
        self.count += 1
    def get_count(self):
        return self.count
# Review 4
import threading
class SafeCounter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0
    def increment(self):
        self.count += 1

def worker(counter):
    for _ in range(1000):
        counter.increment()

counter = SafeCounter()
threads = []
for _ in range(10):
    t = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(counter,))
    t.start()
    threads.append(t)

for t in threads:
    t.join()

# Review 5
def count_occurrences(lst):
    counts = {}
    for item in lst:
        if item in counts:
            counts[item] += 1
        else:
            counts[item] = 1
    return counts
```
### 4. algo.py(This problem is optional)
We start with a constructor for a linked list, cons, which takes a required argument head and an optional argument tail. It returns a linked list representation where the first element is head and rest of the elements are contained in the tail linked list. Empty lists are represented by None in Python.
For example, cons(1, cons(2, cons(3, cons(4)))) constructs a linked list with 4 elements, 1 2 3 4.
To make it easy to inspect the content of a linked list, the listToString method is defined to convert the list to a string, where the string representations of each element are joined by a single space in between.
The myMap method takes a unary function fn and a linked list list. It calls fn in order over each element in list and returns a linked list of the return values of fn.
The myReduce method calls a reducer funtion fn from the beginning of the list to the end and returns the result. For example, if the list is cons(1, cons(2, cons(3))), myReduce(fn, accm, list) should return the result of evaluating fn(fn(fn(accm, 1), 2), 3).
All three methods above are implemented using recursion, leveraging the recursive structure of the linked list.
#### Implementing myReduceRight
Implementing the myReduceRight method. This is similar to myReduce, with the difference that it calls the reducer function fn from the end of the list to the beginning. For example, if the list is cons(1, cons(2, cons(3))), myReduceRight(fn, accm, list) should return the result of evaluating fn(1, fn(2, fn(3, accm))).
#### Requirements:
You SHOULD implement your solution using recursion, instead of anyexplicit for/while loops.
You MUST NOT use any of the previously defined listToString, myMap, myReduce methods in your implementations.
You MUST NOT mutate the original list.
#### To check your implementation, verify that:
* myReduceRight(xTimeTwoPlusY, 0, exampleList) should evalute to 20
* myReduceRight(unfoldCaculation, "accm", exampleList) should evalute to fn(1, fn(2, fn(3, fn(4, accm)))).
* myReduceRight(printXAndReturnY, 0, exampleList) should print out the content of the list in the reverse order.
#### code
```
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self, head, tail):
        self.head = head
        self.tail = tail
    
def cons(head, tail=None):
    return LinkedList(head, tail)
    
def listToString(list):
    if list is None:
        return ""
    if list.tail is None:
        return str(list.head)
    return str(list.head) + " " + listToString(list.tail)

def myMap(fn, list):
    if list is None:
        return None
    return cons(fn(list.head), myMap(fn, list.tail))

def myReduce(fn, accm, list):
    if list is None:
        return accm
    return myReduce(fn, fn(accm, list.head), list.tail)
```
